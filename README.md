# Fake_article_Detection
The aim of the fake article project is to help news readers to identify bias and misinformation in news articles in a quick and reliable way. We have collected news articles from kaggle and used them to train text classification systems to detect fake or real news. You can paste a piece of text from our article and examine its similarity to our collection of true vs. false news articles.Enjoy testing!
